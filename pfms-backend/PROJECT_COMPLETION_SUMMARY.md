- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key handling in services

### ‚úÖ **Scripts & Utilities**
- **Build Script**: `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript
- **Dev Server**: `npm run start:dev` - Development with hot reload
- **Database Setup**: `npm run db:setup` - Builds and seeds database
- **Seed Script**: `npm run seed` - Populates database with test data
- **API Testing**: `test-api.js` - Smoke tests for all endpoints
